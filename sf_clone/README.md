Ideas:

not story heavy mostly through environment?
metoidvania
combat
stranded on planet for whatever reason with damaged ship
must find a way off the planet by upgrading ship
culminates with a cool space battle

starfox/bodyharvest type game:
1 open world
would be cool to have it be a giant planet that you can move fully around
underwater areas?
smaller dungeons?
space station
giant ship
asteroid?
galactic anomaly

vehicles are main way of overcoming obstacles
pilot 
tank
hover tank (cannot fly, over water? lava?)
submarine (under water)
jet
super machine (does it all sortve like samus with the metroid)
